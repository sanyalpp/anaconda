Disclaimer

* You can change the source code which I have made available in order to modify the game, but please do inform me about the changes you have made , as it would be of immense help to me. 
* You could also see the source code for the purpose of learning.
* Finally a request, please dont copy the entire program and make it available in your name , as it is ethically incorrect.

# System Compatibility
* The game is to be installed in Microsoft Windows 98/NT/Windows XP platform.* When the game is installed , a folder named Source Code is created in the corresponding installtion path you choose , it contains the code .Never remove any of the files in the game folder otherwise the game will not run.
* * This program can run on a sysytem of atleast 64 MB RAM.
* You need to have inbuilt PC speakers in order to hear the tune associated with the game. At times your external PC speaker can catch the tune and you can hear it directly from your sound blaster.

# Setup
Directly run the setup.exe file and set the path wherever you like.
After you run the set up, the source code folder inside the folder in which the game is installed will contain the following files:

1. Anaconda.cpp
2. Outlook.h
3. High.h
4. Tune.h
The shortcut to the exe file will be available on the start menu.

# How to play
When you run the exe file follow the following steps:

1. Initially press enter , you will see the name of the game appearing from the sides along with a shrill sound.
2. Press enter once again, you will see a introductory piece with a popular tune which plays for few seconds. Dont press enter until the tune stops playing.(as you could miss the instruction phase if you press enter once or twice while the tune is being played.
3. Press enter once again , as you see the controls of the game.
4. When you press enter another time you will see a options page. You can glide through the options using the up and down arrow keys.Once you select a particular option by using the arrow keys, press enter to activate it.
5. The new game option will set the speed at a very slow pace (suitable for the beginners)
6. You can use the options tag to change the level( the speed actually at which the snake will propagate). Type 1,2,3 ... or 5.
7. You can see the present high score using the high scores tag.
8. Once you have set the speed go to new game options and press enter, you will see the game screen.
9. You can now directly use the arrow keys to start the game as well navigate the snake in the desired direction.


# Rules of the game
1. The arrow keys can be used to navigate the snake.
2. The snake enhances its body by two bits when it eats a green colored food.
3. Th Blue bits are hurdles, always avoid them, if you wanna keep your snake alive.
4. If the snake touches its own body , it dies.
5. 
So , I fully anticipate that you enjoy the game which emulates the snake available on the mobile sets.
